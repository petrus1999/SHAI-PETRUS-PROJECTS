<br>    
<p>WELCOME TO PETRUS JEWELLERY AND  THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN  MY  BUSINESS AND MY  JEWELLERY.</p>
<br>
<p>Jewellery is my passion. To me, it is the product in which Earth and Man meet. Diamonds, gold, platinum and gemstones are Nature’s gifts to us. We should treat and enhance it to show respect for Nature and to bring out the inner beauty in ourselves.</p>
<br>
<p>I employ and contract only the best craftsmen to ensure that, what Nature has created over millennia, is treated with professionalism to ensure that the best is brought out of the material.</p>
<br>
<p>Nothing gives me more pleasure than to see a lady wearing one of my jewellery pieces or one of my watches on a gentleman’s wrist! My jewellery stores are all designed to show respect for the products I sell, but also to show respect for my clients.</p>
